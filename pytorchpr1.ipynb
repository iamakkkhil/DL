        "Now using the classical deep learning framework pipeline, let's build the 1 convolutional layer model. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few notes for those who are beginning with PyTorch:\n",
        "- The model below consists of an `__init__()` portion which is where you include the layers and components of the neural network. In our model, we have a convolutional layer denoted by `nn.Conv2d(...)`. We are dealing with an image dataset that is in a grayscale so we only need one channel going in, hence `in_channels=1`. We hope to get a nice representation of this layer, so we use `out_channels=32`. Kernel size is 3, and for the rest of parameters we use the default values which you can find [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=conv2d#conv2d). \n",
        "- We use 2 back to back dense layers or what we refer to as linear transformations to the incoming data. Notice for `d1` I have a dimension which looks like it came out of nowhere. 128 represents the size we want as output and the (`26*26*32`) represents the dimension of the incoming data. If you would like to find out how to calculate those numbers refer to the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=linear#conv2d). In short, the convolutional layer transforms the input data into a specific dimension that has to be considered in the linear layer. The same applies for the second linear transformation (`d2`) where the dimension of the output of the previous linear layer was added as `in_features=128`, and `10` is just the size of the output which also corresponds to the number of classes.\n",
        "- After each one of those layers, we also apply an activation function such as `ReLU`. For prediction purposes, we then apply a `softmax` layer to the last transformation and return the output of that.  "
